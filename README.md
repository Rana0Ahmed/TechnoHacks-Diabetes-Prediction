## Problem statement
The Problem statement for this project is to use machine learning models to predict if a person has diabetes or
not.

## Dataset
The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

## This project includes:
- Import dependencies.
- Import Dataset from csv file and take a quick look.
- Data visualization with Correlation to gain some insights.
- Feature selection and Feature engineering like scaling data.
- Spliting data into train and test. 
- Modeling using different models like:
  - Logistic Regression.
  - Decision Tree.
  - Random Forest.
  - KNN.
  - Bagging.
  - Gradient Boosting.
  - SVM.
- Applying Cross Validation on the above mentioned models. 

## Highest scores
GradientBoosting model score on Testing data is around(82%).

GradientBoosting model score on cross validation is around(76%).
